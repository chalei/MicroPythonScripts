# MicroWeatherStation

This script will read the sensor DHT11 data and it will create a simple server so the data is shown on a web page.

![Page example on a phone]()


### NOTE:

Take into account that I'm using a Wemos D1 mini and it's DHT11 shield, so in the script you'll see the 'd = dht.DHT11(machine.Pin(2))' and in the example page of the Micropython documentation they use other pin (4).

### TO DO:

- [ ] Better documentation.

- [ ] Add execution images.
