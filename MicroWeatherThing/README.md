# MicroWeatherThing 

This script is used on the Wemos D1 mini running MicroPython port for the ESP8266.

It connects to OpenWeatherMap API in order to get the current weather from a location and it shows the local Temperature and Humidity read from the DHT11 sensor.

What we need to do is download all the code from the `Relase` folder and rename the `MicroWeatherThing.py` file to `main.py` so it will be executed after booting up.


### TO DO:

- [ ] Add delay between execution for the DHT11 sensor and the calls done to the OpenWeatherMap API.

- [ ] Better documentation.
