# MicroPomodoro
This is a script that is used to implement the Pomodoro Technique, with a 25 mins working time and 5 mins break.

This uses the OLED LCD display on the board to show the remaining time, once the time finishes the alarm will go off.

What we need to do is download all the code from the Relase folder and rename the **`Pomodoro.py`** file to **`main.py`** so it will be executed after booting up.


## Parts needed:

  * ESP8266
  
  * OLED display (I2C)
  
  * Buzzer
  
  * LEDs or Neopixel strip.
