# MicroBoard

This is a simple bulletin board so messages are display on a webserver based on the ESP8266

The idea of this script is to host a bulleting board where it will read the messages stored on a file called `messages.txt` from within the ESP8266 

What we need to do is download all the code from the `Relase` folder and rename the `MicroBoard.py` file to `main.py` so it will be executed after booting up.
